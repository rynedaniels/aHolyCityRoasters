We can uncover patterns, trends, and outliers that may not be immediately apparent from raw data. These insights can drive strategic decisions, such as optimizing inventory management, tailoring marketing campaigns, or identifying areas for improvement in customer service. Furthermore, the Pandas library provides powerful data visualization capabilities through its integration with Matplotlib. We can create informative and visually appealing charts, graphs, and plots to present our findings effectively. Visualizations help convey complex information in a more accessible and understandable format, making it easier for stakeholders to grasp the key insights and make informed decisions. **In summary,** by utilizing the properties and methods offered by Pandas, we can efficiently explore and analyze the coffee shop transaction dataset. Through data manipulation, aggregation, and visualization techniques, we can uncover valuable insights that drive business growth and success. This project demonstrates the importance of data-driven decision-making and showcases the power of Python and Pandas in extracting meaningful information from raw data.

The average transaction value stands at $4.69, indicating that customers typically spend a moderate amount per visit. This suggests that the coffee shop has a solid customer base and offers products at accessible price points. <br><br>\n","**Store Performance:**<br><br>\n","The coffee shop operates in three locations: Downtown, Park Circle, and West Ashley. Park Circle emerged as the top-performing store, generating $236,511.17 in revenue with 50,735 transactions. West Ashley followed closely with $232,243.91 in revenue and 50,599 transactions. The Downtown location had the lowest revenue at $230,057.25 and 47,782 transactions.<br><br>\n","The similar transaction counts across all three locations indicate a consistent customer flow. However, the slightly higher revenue in Park Circle suggests that this location may have a higher average transaction value or sells more premium products compared to the other stores. The coffee shop should investigate the factors contributing to Park Circle's success and consider applying successful strategies to the other locations.<br><br>\n","**Product Category Performance:**<br><br>\n","The coffee shop offers a diverse range of product categories, including Coffee, Tea, Bakery, Drinking Chocolate, Flavours, Coffee beans, Loose Tea, Branded, and Packaged Chocolate.\n","Coffee emerges as the top-selling category, with 58,416 transactions and $269,952.45 in revenue. This highlights the strong demand for coffee products and their significant contribution to overall sales. The average price of coffee products is $3.02, indicating a competitive pricing strategy. Tea follows as the second most popular category, with 45,449 transactions and $196,405.95 in revenue. The average price of tea products is $2.82, slightly lower than coffee. This suggests that tea is an essential complementary offering and attracts a substantial customer base. Bakery items also play a crucial role, with 22,796 transactions and $82,315.64 in revenue. The average price of bakery products is $3.55, indicating a moderate pricing point. The coffee shop should ensure a diverse and appealing bakery selection to drive sales in this category. Drinking Chocolate and Coffee beans are notable categories, with average prices of $4.15 and $21.02, respectively. While they have fewer transactions compared to Coffee and Tea, their higher price points contribute significantly to the overall revenue. Flavours and Packaged Chocolate have the lowest transaction counts and revenue, suggesting that they may be ancillary offerings or have limited demand. The coffee shop could reassess the performance and profitability of these categories.<br><br>\n","**Pricing Strategy:**<br><br>\n","The average prices across product categories provide insights into the coffee shop's pricing strategy. Coffee beans have the highest average price at $21.02, indicating a focus on premium or specialty beans. Branded products also have a high average price of $17.72, suggesting partnerships with well-known brands or offering exclusive merchandise.\n","Drinking Chocolate, Tea, and Bakery items have average prices ranging from $2.82 to $4.15, which are accessible to most customers. The coffee shop should ensure that these core offerings remain competitively priced to attract and retain customers.Flavours have the lowest average price at $0.80, indicating that they may be add-ons or small extras that complement other purchases."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"9776023e8ca347b7a54202562ae3fdd6","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h1","formattedRanges":[]},"source":["# Microsoft Excel: Files, Functions, Formulas and Tasks Completed"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"8052d4ffc2404a8c89bcb1fac2b57082","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown"},"source":["## Files:\n","[Original Excel File](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/ujgs9q2xz1pgew20tbp8j/AOriginal_coffee_shop_sales.xlsx?rlkey=copibd1u6w5m9rtru72ga413d&dl=1)\n","\n","\n","[Finished Excel File](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/scl/fi/ofsqcn33j1fohoy1achpq/BFinished_coffee_shop_sales.xlsx?rlkey=by2w3vojxyn50knshkyscyrl1&dl=1)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"c0e8bda208f64f6b9d0c5e80c94d9b96","deepnote_app_block_visible":false,"deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-h2","formattedRanges":[],"is_collapsed":false},"source":["## Functions and Formulas Used: "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"9fb4e4f6586a48d194bb60a9c19e3a6f","deepnote_cell_type":"text-cell-p","formattedRanges":[{"fromCodePoint":0,"marks":{"italic":true},"toCodePoint":134,"type":"marks"}]},"source":["*All function definitions explanations are sourced from support.microsoft.com.
